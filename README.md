## Installation and Configuration

Install the `cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch` package via composer:

```shell
composer require cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch
```

### Laravel 

Add the service provider and facade to `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Cviebrock\LaravelElasticsearch\ServiceProvider::class,   
]

'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Elasticsearch' => Cviebrock\LaravelElasticsearch\Facade::class,
]
```
    
Publish the configuration file:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Cviebrock\LaravelElasticsearch\ServiceProvider"
```

##### Alternative configuration method via .env file

After you publish the configuration file as suggested above, you may configure Elastic Search
by adding the following to laravel ```.env``` file
  
```ini
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
ELASTICSEARCH_SCHEME=http
ELASTICSEARCH_USER=
ELASTICSEARCH_PASS=
```  

### Lumen

If you work with Lumen, please register the LumenServiceProvider in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$app->register(Cviebrock\LaravelElasticsearch\LumenServiceProvider::class);
```

And manually copy the configuration file to your application.

**Note:** don't forget to register your elasticsearch.php config in bootstrap/app.php
```php
$app->configure('elasticsearch');
```



## Usage

The `Elasticsearch` facade is just an entry point into the ES client, so previously
you might have used:

```php
$data = [
    'body' => [
        'testField' => 'abc'
    ],
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'id' => 'my_id',
];

$client = ClientBuilder::create()->build();
$return = $client->index($data);
```

You can now replace those last two lines with simply:

```php
$return = Elasticsearch::index($data);
```

That will run the command on the default connection.  You can run a command on
any connection (see the `defaultConnection` setting and `connections` array in
the configuration file).

```php
$return = Elasticsearch::connection('connectionName')->index($data);
```

Please be noticed that you should not use Facade in Lumen. 
So, in Lumen - you should use IoC or get the ElasticSearch service object from the application.
```php
$elasticSearch = $this->app('elasticsearch');
```
