## Installation and Configuration

Install the current version of the `anashaat/laravel-elasticsearch` package via composer:

```sh
composer require anashaat/laravel-elasticsearch
```

If you are using ElasticSearch version 5, then install version 2 of this package:

```sh
composer require mailerlite/laravel-elasticsearch:^2
```

### Laravel

The package's service provider will automatically register its service provider.

Publish the configuration file:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="MailerLite\LaravelElasticsearch\ServiceProvider"
```

##### Alternative configuration method via .env file

After you publish the configuration file as suggested above, you may configure ElasticSearch
by adding the following to your application's `.env` file (with appropriate values):

```ini
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
ELASTICSEARCH_SCHEME=http
ELASTICSEARCH_USER=
ELASTICSEARCH_PASS=
```

If you are logging in via API keys, you will need to fill in these values:

```ini
ELASTICSEARCH_API_ID=
ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY=
```


##### Connecting to AWS Elasticsearch Service

If you are connecting to ElasticSearch instances on Amazon AWS, then you'll also
need to `composer require aws/aws-sdk-php:^3.80` and add the following to your
`.env` file:

```ini
AWS_ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED=true
AWS_REGION=...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

If you have to use another authentication method having custom credentials (i.e. `instanceProfile()`),
you have to publish the configuration file and use the **aws_credentials**:

```php
<?php
// config/elasticsearch.php

$provider = \Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::instanceProfile();
$memoizedProvider = \Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::memoize($provider);
$credentials = $memoizedProvider()->wait();

...

'hosts' => [
    [
        'host'            => env('ELASTICSEARCH_HOST', 'localhost'),
        // For local development, the default Elasticsearch port is 9200.
        // If you are connecting to an Elasticsearch instance on AWS, you probably want to set this to null
        'port'            => env('ELASTICSEARCH_PORT', 9200),
        'scheme'          => env('ELASTICSEARCH_SCHEME', null),
        'user'            => env('ELASTICSEARCH_USER', null),
        'pass'            => env('ELASTICSEARCH_PASS', null),

        // If you are connecting to an Elasticsearch instance on AWS, you will need these values as well
        'aws'             => env('AWS_ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED', false),
        'aws_region'      => env('AWS_REGION', ''),
        'aws_key'         => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', ''),
        'aws_secret'      => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', '')
        'aws_credentials' => $credentials
    ],
],
```

If you have a job that runs in supervisor, you have to use the Closure.
This way the credentials will be renewed at runtime.

```php
<?php
// config/elasticsearch.php

$provider = \Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::instanceProfile();
$memoizedProvider = \Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::memoize($provider);

...

'hosts' => [
    [
        ...
        'aws_credentials' => $memoizedProvider
    ],
],
```

If you are using `php artisan config:cache`, you cannot have the Closure in your config file, call it like this:

```php
<?php
// config/elasticsearch.php

...

'hosts' => [
    [
        ...
        'aws_credentials' => [\Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::class, 'defaultProvider'],
    ],
],
```

#### Logging Configuration  

- **Custom Logger Support**: You can now define `logObject` in the configuration using a class reference (e.g., `\App\Logging\ElasticsearchLogger::class`).  
- **Automatic Resolution**: If `logObject` is a class reference, it will be resolved via `app($logObject)`.  
- **Alternative Logging**: If no logger is provided, but `logPath` and `logLevel` are set, a default `StreamHandler` logger will be created.  
- **Example Usage**:  

  ```php
  'logObject' => \App\Logging\ElasticsearchLogger::class,
  ```

This allows for greater flexibility in managing Elasticsearch logs.

### Lumen

If you work with Lumen, please register the service provider and configuration in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$app->register(MailerLite\LaravelElasticsearch\ServiceProvider::class);
$app->configure('elasticsearch');
```

Manually copy the configuration file to your application.



## Usage

The `Elasticsearch` facade is just an entry point into the [ES client](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php),
so previously you might have used:

```php
use Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder;

$data = [
    'body' => [
        'testField' => 'abc'
    ],
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'id' => 'my_id',
];

$client = ClientBuilder::create()->build();
$return = $client->index($data);
```

You can now replace those last two lines with simply:

```php
use Elasticsearch;

$return = Elasticsearch::index($data);
```

That will run the command on the default connection.  You can run a command on
any connection (see the `defaultConnection` setting and `connections` array in
the configuration file).

```php
$return = Elasticsearch::connection('connectionName')->index($data);
```

Lumen users who wish to use Facades can do so by editing the
`bootstrap/app.php` file to include the following:

```php
$app->withFacades(true, [
    ...
    MailerLite\LaravelElasticsearch\Facade::class => 'Elasticsearch',
    ...
]);
```

Lumen users who aren't using facades will need to use dependency injection
or the application container in order to get the ES service object:

```php
// using injection:
public function handle(\Mailerlite\LaravelElasticsearch\Manager $elasticsearch)
{
    $elasticsearch->ping();
}

// using application container:
$elasticSearch = $this->app('elasticsearch');
```

Of course, dependency injection and the application container work
for Laravel applications as well.



## Advanced Usage

Because the package is a wrapper around the official Elastic client, you can
do pretty much anything with this package.  Not only can you perform standard
CRUD operations, but you can monitor the health of your Elastic cluster programmatically,
back it up, or make changes to it.  Some of these operations are done through
"namespaced" commands, which this package happily supports.

To grab statistics for an index:

```php
$stats = Elasticsearch::indices()->stats(['index' => 'my_index']);
$stats = Elasticsearch::nodes()->stats();
$stats = Elasticsearch::cluster()->stats();
```

To create and restore snapshots (read the Elastic docs about creating repository paths and plugins first):

```php
$response = Elasticsearch::snapshots()->create($params);
$response = Elasticsearch::snapshots()->restore($params);
```

To delete whole indices (be careful!):

```php
$response = Elasticsearch::indices()->delete(['index' => 'my_index']);
```

Please remember that this package is a thin wrapper around a large number of very
sophisticated and well-documented Elastic features.  Information about those features
and the methods and parameters used to call them can be found in the
[Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/index.html).
Help with using them is available via the [Elastic forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/)
and on sites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/elasticsearch).



## Console commands

This package also provides some useful console commands.

Check if an index exists:

```sh
php artisan laravel-elasticsearch:utils:index-exists <your_elasticsearch_index_name>
```

Create an index:

```sh
php artisan laravel-elasticsearch:utils:index-create <your_elasticsearch_index_name>
```

Delete an index:

```sh
php artisan laravel-elasticsearch:utils:index-delete <your_elasticsearch_index_name>
```

Create or update index mapping:
_Note: The index mapping file must contain a valid JSON mapping definition as Elasticsearch expects, for example:_

```json
{
    "body": {
        "_source": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "properties": {
            "id": {
                "type": "keyword"
            },
            "property_1": {
                "type": "text"
            },
            "property_2": {
                "type": "text"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```sh
php artisan laravel-elasticsearch:utils:index-create-or-update-mapping <your_elasticsearch_index_name> <json_mapping_absolute_file_path>
```

Creates an alias:

```sh
php artisan laravel-elasticsearch:utils:alias-create <your_elasticsearch_index_name> <your_elasticsearch_alias_name>
```

Remove index from an alias:

```sh
php artisan laravel-elasticsearch:utils:alias-remove-index <your_elasticsearch_index_name> <your_elasticsearch_alias_name>
```

Switch index on alias (useful for zero-downtime release of the new index):

```sh
php artisan laravel-elasticsearch:utils:alias-switch-index <your_NEW_elasticsearch_index_name> <your_OLD_elasticsearch_index_name> <your_elasticsearch_alias_name>
```
