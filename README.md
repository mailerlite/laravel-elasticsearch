## Installation and Configuration

Install the `cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch` package via composer:

```sh
composer require cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch
```

### Laravel

The package will automatically register itself.
    
Publish the configuration file:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Cviebrock\LaravelElasticsearch\ServiceProvider"
```

##### Alternative configuration method via .env file

After you publish the configuration file as suggested above, you may configure Elastic Search
by adding the following to your application's `.env` file (with appropriate values):
  
```ini
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
ELASTICSEARCH_SCHEME=http
ELASTICSEARCH_USER=
ELASTICSEARCH_PASS=
```  

### Lumen

If you work with Lumen, please register the service provider and configuration in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$app->register(Cviebrock\LaravelElasticsearch\LumenServiceProvider::class);
$app->configure('elasticsearch');
```

Manually copy the configuration file to your application.


## Usage

The `Elasticsearch` facade is just an entry point into the [ES client](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php),
so previously you might have used:

```php
$data = [
    'body' => [
        'testField' => 'abc'
    ],
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'type' => 'my_type',
    'id' => 'my_id',
];

$client = ClientBuilder::create()->build();
$return = $client->index($data);
```

You can now replace those last two lines with simply:

```php
$return = Elasticsearch::index($data);
```

That will run the command on the default connection.  You can run a command on
any connection (see the `defaultConnection` setting and `connections` array in
the configuration file).

```php
$return = Elasticsearch::connection('connectionName')->index($data);
```

Lumen users who aren't using facades will need to use dependency injection or the application container
in order to get the ES service object:

```php
// using injection:
public function handle(\Cviebrock\LaravelElasticsearch\Manager $elasticsearch)
{
  $elasticsearch->ping();
}

// using application container:
$elasticSearch = $this->app('elasticsearch');
```

Of course, DI and the application container work for Laravel as well.
